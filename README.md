## Introduction
This repository presents the code and analysis completed during Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The task focused on performing thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a chosen dataset (Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle).

## Dataset
The <a href = "https://github.com/Seetha-2002/PRODIGY_DS_02/raw/main/Titanic_Dataset(Train).csv">`Titanic_Dataset(Train)`</a>The Titanic dataset is well-known in the field of data science, providing comprehensive information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic details and survival outcomes. Recognized for its educational significance, this dataset is highly regarded as a valuable resource for exploring various data analysis methodologies and techniques.

## Task Description
The main objective of this task was to meticulously clean the data and perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover valuable insights. This involved handling missing data points and carefully examining relationships between variables to identify significant patterns and trends in the dataset.

## Key Findings
-Implemented rigorous data cleaning procedures to handle missing values and remove duplicate entries.
- Investigated complex relationships between variables including gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rates.
-Uncovered notable patterns and trends in the data, such as the higher survival rates among females, the influence of passenger class on survival outcomes, and the correlation between age and survival probabilities.

## Conclusion
The detailed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset provided valuable insights into the factors influencing survival rates during the tragic Titanic disaster. This analysis deepens our understanding of historical events and demonstrates the effective application of data science methodologies to extract meaningful insights from intricate datasets.
